- Castle SE: Need "Long Sword Dragonslayer" at GiveTreasure event #59 @ 15,10 - instead of the Long Sword +5 I have there now
- Zhentil Keep: Al-Hyam Dazid should have the ability to cast MU spells (same as all the others below)
- Kobold Caves: Envoy should have the ability to cast 2 MU spells (same as Nomad Shaman & Level X MUs)
- Go back through ALL "Who Tries" events.  I don't think their saving throw types are set (to anything)
- Nomad camp: Nomad Shaman does not have any spells - how do I do that?  (same as Level X MUs)
- Overland: Phase spider is missing these abilities: "Phase spdr psn", "See invisible", "Blink"
- Overland: icon_ankheg is really the giant crawfish icon ðŸ¤·
- Overland: Ankheg needs "Dragon Acid" specab
- Valhingen: Need a sling of seeking for GiveTreasure #33 @ 15,8 - replace the sling+3 with it
- Stojanow Gate: Level 6 MU monster does not have any spells - how do I do that?  (same as Level 3 MU)
- Wealthy/Bane: Mace doesn't have any spells memorized.  How does that work?
- Wealthy/Bane: Step Event 2, Text Statement #56 seems like it is empty and may have been a mistake, but was in game39.  Decide what to do with it
- Wealthy/Bane: Need a Dust of Disappearance item for GiveTreasure #35 @ 9,12
- Library: Black lines around top and bottom of side-tiles in wa_wall_wood.png.  It's because there are some dark brown not-quite-black pixels around the top/bottom
- Library: Wall slot #5 - Door44 doesn't quite match with the wa_wall_wood.png.  Probably need a different door png
- Slums: Level 3 MU monster (Ohlo) has no spells memorized/no way to cast.   Use special abilities?
- Slums: Where are the trolls in the Old Rope Guild?
- Kuto's Well: icons for giant lizard
- Sokol keep: Lethal poison ability for poisonous frog
- Sokol keep: Step event 4 #54 needs a Poisonous Frog picture and 4 poisonous frogs
- Sokol keep: Better picture for smallpic_spectre.png.  It is the same as smallpic_wraith.png
- Fix the initial guided tour in Phlan
- Get the backgrounds and walls finished in all other levels besides civilized and Mendor
- Make a church wall/door for the temples in the civilized area (and maybe other areas like temple of bane)
- Do an export of all libraries and lvl files just in case
- My monsters have Attacks defined that I thought would match their weaponry.  Will they equip their weapons while fighting?  See what the behavior is just in case - if they ready their armor, then I need to go back and change their AC


Low:
- There is a tiny little shield icon in smallpic_Blacksmith.png from my screenshot.  Haha.  Should re-grab it
