# uaf_levels

This is work done on levels for the Dungeon Craft open source engine.  Includes, but may not be limited to, the conversion of Ray Dyer's Game39 (Pool of Radiance) FRUA game.


To play the game, click on the shortcut or open the DungeonCraft_\*.exe included in the distribution.  To modify the design, use the latest version of DungeonCraft to open the .dsn folder included in the distribution.
